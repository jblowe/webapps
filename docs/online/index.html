            <p>These "webapps" are a suite of browser-based tools which access the CollectionSpace service to provide
              critical functionality not provided by the "regular" user interface.</p>
        For example, the "regular" user interface mostly supports acting on one record at a time,
            while the webapps generally operate on or create <i>sets of records</i>, a set
	    being defined as something like "all objects in a range of Museum Numbers", e.g.,
	    "2010.54.1" to "2010.54.10", or "all objects in a location or sequence of
	    locations" (e.g. "W3.10.b.2.13" to "W3.10.b.2.14"), "all
	    objects in this group", or "all the images in this folder on my computer".
	    Typical operations performed are updating the data for sets of objects, or creating move or
            inventory actions for such sets.
        <p>The overall UX ("user experience") is intended to be
	    straightforward -- the individual <i>updating webapps</i>
	    contain only a few input fields,
	    no more than a couple of buttons, and involve (usually)
	    a short two- or three-step interaction: 1) fill in search values for
	    a set of records,
	    click Search, 2) verify response, fill in data for individual items, and 3) click Update and wait patiently for
	    results. (NB: the CollectionSpace backend (i.e. database system) is very slow, and this is the limiting factor
	    for the speed of the webapps.)
            </p>
        <p>Besides move and data update operations, a few other webapps provide a means to view database content
          (e.g., authority hierarchies) in useful ways.</p>

	    <p>There are four types of webapps provided:</p>
	    <ol>
        <li><b>"Portals"</b>, which provide lightning-fast search access to the collection, along with the ability to download
	      spreadsheet-ready extracts, browse images, and so on; and</li>
        <li><b>Procedural webapps</b>, which mostly 'move' objects to other locations; and support uploading media (images). That is, they mostly
        create <i>procedure records</i> (e.g. <i>Media</i> or <i>Movement</i> records) in CollectionSpace</li>
        <li><b>Data update webapps</b>, which update data elements in (mostly) <i>collectionobject</i> records.</li>
        <li><b>Reporting webapps</b>, which are essential "canned searches" that return a information in a pre-determined format about a pre-determined set of records
          in the collection (and do not change any data).</li>
      </ol>

  CollectionSpace. The user selects a set of files on their local
  computer (using the "Choose Files" button) and then uploads these to the CSpace server. They are then "ingested" into CSpace via a nightly import job.  There is an option to perform the ingestion process online, but since the process is slow -- several seconds at least per image -- the usual practice is to use the nightly batch option.</p>

              <p>This webapp allows registrars, curators, and subject matter experts to quickly verify, edit, and/or update values in several important fields (the so-called "key information fields"). The objects displayed in the KIR webapp are selected according to their storage location(s). Depending on the application (e.g., NAGPRA, physical inventory, retrospective cataloging), the identity of these key fields can vary, so the webapp accommodates different sets of&#x2014;and configurations of&#x2014;data fields. In most cases these are editable, but for some (e.g., Donor), the KIR webapp serves as a way to quickly determine the state of data entry and to identify particular records that need to be updated in the CSpace UI.</p>

The sets of available "Key Information" fields are the same as in the KIR and the OIR webapps. The BOE webapp differs in one very important aspect from either KIR or OIR: the values in the fields to be updated are not displayed by the BOE webapp. The user must know in advance what the existing values of these fields are, and must also be certain that they want to override all values in a particular field with a single value that the user can enter into each field. The user can update several fields at once, or only a single field at a time.</p>

              <p>This webapp produces both packing lists and decanting lists, and offers PDF and CSV options for both. For packing lists, a range of storage locations is entered, and a list of all objects at those locations is generated, grouped by current storage location. To restrict this list to objects from a certain place or continent, a collection place can be specified. To produce decanting lists that facilitate organizing objects by cultural group, the user need only check the "group by culture" checkbox.</p>

              <p>This webapp allows users to see a visual representation of the organization of any of six hierarchical authorities (all but storage location). The desired hierarchy is calculated and displayed as a series of hierarchically nested facets, which are all set to be initially open. Users can click any facet arrow to collapse (or reopen) that facet, and can click on any term in the displayed hierarchy to see the corresponding full CSpace authority term record.</p>

              <p>The workflow helper allows the user to search for objects in a range of Update At dates. The principle
                use case is to check up on work done in a particular period, say "yesterday" or "last Wednesday".
                Nowadays this same search can be done in the regular UI via Advanced Search on CollectionObjects.

          the checkbox.</li>
          <li>When you click Update Group, a complicated calculation is done and the group is created
            (if it doesn't yet exist), and the membership is adjusted to add or delete objects as indicated.</li>
          <li><b><i>Important caveat</i></b>: all the members must exist already in the Solr core (i.e. since yesterday), since
          the Solr core is used to list the details of the members of the group.</li>

            field. E.g.if you enter 2015, 9, and 12 in the first three fields, and enter one for count, the app will try to create one
	    object record with accessinon number <tt>2016.9.12</tt>.
	  <li>The program checks to see that none of the object numbers already exists,
            but it does not at the moment help you find the last values to use if you are trying to add on to an existing series.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3 class="subheader">Foibles and Caveats</h3>
      The webapps have a number of foibles you should know about: 
      <ul>
        <li>Term matching for authority fields, e.g. Field Collection Place or Ethnographic Group may include terms from other vocabularies and non-preferred terms (however, deleted terms no longer show up.) In fact, the selection algorithm is a bit complicated. </li>
        <li>Term matching for museum numbers is on the literal value of the object number, but the range is calculated on the basis of the museum number sort field (which you cannot see, except when viewing the catalog record). </li>
        <li>For locations, however, both matching and ranges are based on the literal value (Locations do not have a sort field, they sort &#x201C;as themselves&#x201D;.) </li>
        <li>You do not have to enter an End Location. If you don&#x2019;t the app will use the Start Location and fill it in for you. </li>
        <li>Most of the webapps have a limit of 500 locations in a range, and 500 objects in a location. The Packing List is the exception: it will try to render the whole museum if you ask it. This value, incidentally, is based solely on the limitations of the &#x201C;average web browser&#x201D;.</li>
