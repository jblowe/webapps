Any combination of fields may be used.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Some fields have an option of searching as either \"keyword\", \"phrase\", or \"exact\".\r\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n        <li><strong>Keyword</strong>: This will return all records that contain all of the words entered in that input field, in any order(e.g. searching <tt>textile fragment</tt> will also return <i>Textile and brush fragments</i>, etc.)\r\n        <li><strong>Phrase</strong>: This will match the search terms in order anywhere in the field (e.g. searching <tt>textile fragment</tt> in phrase will also return <i>Loom model and textile fragment</i>, <i>Netting or textile fragment</i>, etc.)\r\n        <li><strong>Exact</strong>: This will only return records where the field value is <i>exactly</i> what you input (e.g. an exact search for the <tt>textile fragment</tt> will retrieve 566 records whereas the keyword search for this term will retrieve 659.)\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Displaying Search Results</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your search has one or more results, you'll see three panes presented -- Results, Facets, and Maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three options for display.\r\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n        <li><strong>List</strong> is ideal for seeing summaries of\r\n        many records at once.\r\n        <li><strong>Full</strong> shows the full details of each record, including images.\r\n        <li><strong>Grid</strong> is ideal for viewing many objects at once while also displaying images. Clicking the museum number in any view will bring you to the Full view of that object. Clicking an image will open the full resolution image in a new tab.\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Facets</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    After performing a search, clicking the \"Facets\" tab will show you a list, in descending frequency order, of values which appear the records returned by your search. For example, if you search for Collector <tt>Dr. Berta Bascom</tt> (exact), you will see under Field Collection Place <i>\"Oyo, Nigeria, Western Africa\" 448, \"Ghana, Western Africa, Africa\" 251</i> etc., meaning there are\r\n    448 objects collected by Dr. Berta Bascom in Oyo, Nigeria; 251 objects collected by her from Ghana, etc. Clicking on the name of a facet will refine your search, returning only the results matching that value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Maps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may choose two different mapping options for your result set:\r\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n    <li><strong>Berkeley Mapper</strong>: your results will be passed to Berkeley Mapper and plotted there.\r\n    <li><p><strong>Google Static Maps</strong>: up to 65 of your results will be plotted on the spot using Google Maps.\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that only records which have LatLongs will be plotted!\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Statistics</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    This option permits further analyses of the returned values. Select the field on which you want a summary (count), then select fields to be displayed associated with that count and select \u201cDisplay Summary\u201d. Scroll to the bottom of the displayed data for the count(s).\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Using a Downloaded .csv File</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n    Search results and Summary statistics can be downloaded to your local computer in \".csv\" format (\"character-separated values\").  Specifically, the displayed table is saved to a file with the cells separated by tabs and the rows separated by \"carriage returns\". There is no encapsulation of the values (i.e. quotes around strings).  Most spreadsheet programs will open these files straightforwardly, but there are some tricks:\r\n\r\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n        <li>To open (import) the file in FileMaker Pro, you should change the extension from .csv to .tab; then FMP will handle the file properly.\r\n        <li>To open the file in Open Office, open the file and set the Text Import settings as follows : under \"Separated by\" select Tab as the delimiter and make sure the Text Delimiter is empty.\r\n        <li>To open the file in MS Excel, try the following (the process differs from version to version of Windows and Excel, good hunting!):\r\n        <ol style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\r\n            <li>Open Excel\r\n            <li>File -> New (i.e. make a new blank workbook)\r\n            <li>Data -> From Text (i.e. under the Data menu Item, click \"From Text\" at the left)\r\n            <li>Imports (under Tools at the bottom of the window)\r\n            <li>In this window:\r\n            <ol type=\"a\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\r\n                <li>check Delimited\r\n                <li>check My Data has Headers\r\n                <li>click Next\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <li>In this window:\r\n            <ol type=\"a\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\r\n                <li>select Tab for delimiter\r\n                <li>{None} for encapsulating character\r\n                <li>click Next\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <li>In this window:\r\n            <ol type=\"a\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\r\n                <li>highlight the first column of the data file (accession number)\r\n                <li>select Text as the format for this column\r\n                <li>click OK\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </ol>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>",
